Understanding about (a+b)^2  

The whole concept is about the calculating the area of square with side length "a+b" 

Considering the whole square into 4 different pieces 

One small square with side length "a" - Area of this becomes 'a^2'
second small square of length "b" -area of this becomes "b^2"
Third piece rectangle of length - a+b - "area of Rectangle becomes -a.b
Fourth piece rectangle of length - a+b - "area of Rectangle becomes -a.b

Hence the total area of square becomes - a^2 +b^2 +2ab 

Now comes the Retail domain - considering amazon as example 
if a gives how Marketing of amazon products increased their sales 
and b gives about how discount prices on their products effected their sales 
At Amazon:

Running ads increases product visibility (a)

Offering discounts attracts price-sensitive shoppers ( b)

Combining both leads to a multiplicative effect (2ab ) → ads + discounts work better together than separately.

✅ Example numbers:

Ads increase sales by 10%.

Discounts increase sales by 15%.

Together, they might push sales up by more than 25%, because of synergy.

This concept can be used in sales prediction model
In Machine Learning 
To capture nonlinear effects.

To let the model learn how combined features amplify (or weaken) outcomes.
In retail and ML:

Simple additive models miss out on interactions.

(a+b)^2   captures both individual and combined effects.

This makes predictions and insights more accurate and actionable.
Why squared terms?
When we build models, we’re always balancing two goals:
1️⃣ Predictive power → how well the model fits the data and makes accurate predictions.
2️⃣ Interpretability → how easily humans can understand what the model is doing.
